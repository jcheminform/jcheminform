# [Put Your Collection Title Here]

This template can be used to propose a collection in the Journal of Cheminformatics (see [this list of current and past collections](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/collections)). A collection is also known as a special issue or thematic series, and is used to group articles about a certain theme (like [PubChem 3D](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/pubchem3d)) or around a conferences (like [the proceedings of the 11th ICCS](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/ICCS11)). This issue allows us to coordinate the discussion and development of a collection proposal. A collection often is linked to a [Call of Papers](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/upcoming-special-issues). The main text of this ticket can be edited after you submit it, as more details become clear, or when updates are made based on discussions. The first post is just to start the discussion. You can remove this paragraph before you submit your proposal.

## Checklist

You acknowledge the [submission guidelines](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines) and in particular that all contributions adhere to the regular journal expectations:

 - [ ] source code and scripts with an OSI-approved license
 - [ ] data is provided under an open data license (CCZero, public domain, CC-BY)

## Proposal

Describe here what the collection is about. Should describe the broad topic, and ideally, specific aspects of the topic you'd like to see articles about. This need not be an exhaustive list at the proposal stage, but should provide a flavor of what you're looking for. In addition, the more fleshed out this is, the easier to take it and convert it to a Call for Papers.


 - [ ] this collection is about a certain theme
 - [ ] this collection is for a conference

## Keywords

Add here a comma-separated list of keywords 

## Proposed guest editors

 * First editor <ORCID>
 * Second editor <ORCID>

 ## Possible authors

This can be kept empty if you want to keep the call fully open. But it is useful to be able to seed the collection if you have a few authors in mind, who you (or another guest editor) can invite directly. At the proposal stage you don't need to have any commitments from possible authors,

 * Author 1
 * Author 2
